# DSA : Data structures are the way of storing and orgnizing data in computer
# built-in support for several data structures list,dictionaries,sets 
# Python list and arrays - 
# In python list and arrays are the built-in data structure that serves a dynamic array
# list are ordered, mutuble and can contain elements of different types
# Time Complexity -
# time complexity is the number of operations needed to run an algorithm for large amount of data
# and the number of operations can be considered as time because the computer uses some time for each operation
